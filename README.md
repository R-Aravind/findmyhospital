# Medicus.com

This website or web-app aims to help people to find quality healthcare near them and the best medication that suits them. Our society is having many accidental deaths due to medical error and bad caring from the hospital. So we made a review system for the patients itself to submit their experience thereby, helping others to choose the best hospital or the best doctors near them.
